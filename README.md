# Project2

## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I chose to analyze a data set that has information on coffee consumption data using the Global Coffee Health dataset. My goal is to understand stress levels in how the effect of coffee consumption and other factors that are based on lifestyle habits can predict a personâ€™s Stress_Level (Low, Medium, or High) using the Global Coffee Health dataset and to create a predictive model using a Decision Tree Classifier to categorize that into stress levels such as to Low, Medium, or High based on their lifestyle habits and coffee consumption. 

Questions 
- Can lifestyle factors such as coffee intake, sleep hours, physical activity, age, and BMI accurately predict a person's stress level?
- Which features are most influential in determining stress levels?

## THE DATASET
The data I chose to use is a file found from Kaggle called https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/global-coffee-health-dataset.

## VISUALIZATION/DATA UNDERSTANDING
To explore this data, I plan to use Decision Trees.
